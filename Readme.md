## Reason for Absence

### Examination Period:
The absence on this day was due to the university's **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** exam, which required focused preparation and dedication. As a result, regular learning activities were temporarily paused.

- **Impact of Absence**: The absence did not hinder progress, as the focus was on successfully completing the exam.

## Next Steps

Regular learning activities will resume with renewed focus and commitment following the exam. The goal is to continue mastering the foundational and advanced JavaScript concepts covered so far and apply them effectively in real-world projects.
