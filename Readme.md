# JavaScript Logical Operators, Nullish Coalescing, Polyfills, and Transpilers

## Overview

This branch delves into essential JavaScript concepts, particularly focusing on the **Logical Operators**, **Nullish Coalescing Operator**, and the usage of **Polyfills** and **Transpilers**. These topics are critical for writing robust, modern, and backward-compatible JavaScript code.

## Topics Covered

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean expressions, enabling conditional logic in JavaScript.

#### Types of Logical Operators:

- **AND (&&)**:
    - Evaluates to `true` if both operands are truthy.
    - Short-circuits (stops evaluation) if the first operand is falsy.

- **OR (||)**:
    - Evaluates to `true` if at least one operand is truthy.
    - Short-circuits if the first operand is truthy.

- **NOT (!)**:
    - Inverts the truthiness of the operand.

#### Use Cases:
- Combine conditions in `if` statements.
- Set default values using `||` (prior to ES2020).
- Logical negation with `!`.

### Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

The `??` operator is used to provide a default value for `null` or `undefined`, while still considering other falsy values like `0` or `""` as valid.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
let result = value1 ?? value2;
